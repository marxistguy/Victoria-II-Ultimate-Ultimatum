EVTDESC97615;'Revere the emperor and expel the barbarians!'\n\nThis is the slogan chanted by neo-confucian activists, reacting to the Tokugawa shogunate's opening of Japan to foreigners. There have been growing reports of violence all over the country, primarily against foreign visitors and statesmen but also against the shogunate itself.

EVTDESC97617;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan.

EVTNAME97620;The Death of Iesada;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97620;Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The Southern Tozama Daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become shogun, while the fudai daimyo and shogunate officials are more in favor of Tokugawa Iemochi-- even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97621;Tokugawa Yoshinobu is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97621;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Yoshinobu as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the tozama daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the tozama will be permitted more influence within the shogunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97622;Even though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new shogun following Iesada's death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu... a candidate favored by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun-- instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama. It is becoming increasingly clear that a larger change is necessary. Perhaps the time has come for the Emperor to rule Japan, a single leader to bring the nation into this new era?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97624;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Iemochi as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the fudai daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the outsider tozama will have their influence in the bakufu kept to a minimum.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97625;The shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point.

EVTDESC97648;While Kyoto has long been the capital of Japan, and home to the Imperial Court, the city of Edo has become the de facto capital-- for centuries it has been the center of shogunate power, as well as a cultural and administrative center.

The ill-tempered westerner is demanding an end to the Japanese policy of Sokoku-- specifically trading rights in several ports, extraterritoriality for American sailors and protection for their shipwrecks. At first he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible. Thus it falls to the Shogun to either agree to his demands, risking the appearance of weakness, or refuse and bring the wrath of the Americans upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97660;The Taisho Era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97660;With the ascension of Emperor Taisho, whose poor health has prompted a shift in political power from Japan's old guard to the Imperial Diet, democratic parties are beginning to see their influence spread throughout the country. Though democratic tradition is not deeply rooted, the idea of enfranchisement as a right of the individual Japanese citizen has become far more broadly accepted. Students, university professors and journalists inspired by Western schools of thought have organized public demonstrations to demand new reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97665;The Satsuma Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97665;A growing dissatisfaction among the former samurai with the abolition of the han system and the resulting reduction in their personal prestige has crystallized in a rebellion.
