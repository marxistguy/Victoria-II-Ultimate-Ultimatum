EVTNAME999000;Trade Policy Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism? We report, you decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999000;Let the debate take its own course, and let the chips fall where they may!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC999000;Freedom and liberty of trade shall not perish from this Earth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999001;Economic Policy Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999001;The debate had been going on for several hours, when a candidate stepped forward and presented the arguments for their cause which silenced all opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME999002;Religious Policy Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999002;'The morality and virtue of our people have started to decline!'' This statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality. They have started to question the country''s view on religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999002;There are no Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME999003;Citizenship Policy Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999003;Two debaters are arguing heatedly about their views. The rest of the hall sits dumbfounded when words like aliens, minorities, ethnic and cultural groups are thrown between the two. One wish that immigrants should adapt to the dominant culture while the other believes that they should retain their cultural heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999003;Give them residency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999003;We need to limit their citizenship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME999004;War Policy Debate ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999004;Patriots and pacifists are fighting in the townhouse, using words to hurt and kill their enemies. A long since dead and buried dispute between $COUNTRY$ and its neighbor has once again shown its ugly head. Patriots wish to invade the country while pacifists believe that there are other ways to resolve the dispute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999004;We are patriots and we are going to fight for our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999004;Violence can be used, but in this situation it would be meaningless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC999004;War between countries is never good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA999131;Hail to our glorious leader!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999132;Return Of The King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999132;The royal family had lost it's power for far too long. Now it is restored - and the new king shall bestow his grace upon $COUNTRY$ once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999132;Long live the king!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999133;All Power To El Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999133;"This is TNT, your brand new state newspaper, and I am Juanito, your new favorite news article writer! \n For today's headliner, we have the amazing story of El Presidente and his way to power! \n It all started back in... [...] \n\n And remember folks: Don't read this so called ""newspaper"" from Betty Boom - it is filled with anti-patriotic lies against our great El Presidente!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999133;Long live El Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999134;The Bourgeois Is Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999134;Money makes right - and we have proven it once and for all! Finally we can have our rightful taste of the sweet fruits of power. \n Jeeves, bring us  some wine so we can celebrate this occasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME999033;Surge Of Liberalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999033;It looks like the liberals have a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their new agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999031;We will have an eye on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999040;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999040;'Why should only the rich be allowed to vote? We also pay taxes, so why shouldn't we have something to say in politics?' \n The industrial revolution has empowered the middle class. More and more businessmen are making more and more money. It seems only natural that they demand voting rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999040;They are right - support their reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999040;Voting rights for the middle class? Nay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC999040;A reform is long past due - issue a new voting right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999041;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999041;'...and mind you, we even pay way higher taxes then they do! Still, their votes are worth more than ours - I ask you: is that really fair?' \n While being allowed to vote, the middle class feels diminished by the current weighted voting rights. Maybe we should issue a reform to make all their votes equal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999041;Sounds like a good idea, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999041;Stop these ungrateful wretches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC999041;We shall do this right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999042;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999042;'Why is everyone trying to keep us out of politics? Because we are uneducated? They call us minors, but that is a lie! Our sweet and toil has brought the nation forward! We have waited long enough - now we demand our just due!' \n It looks like the poor finally demand voting rights. Maybe we should grant them a voice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999042;Better late then never.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999042;Better never than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC999042;Better now than later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999043;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999043;'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed' \n - Thomas Jefferson;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999043;A rightful initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999043;Enough is enough! Stop that nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC999043;Equal votes for equal chances - NOW!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999044;Right In The Face;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999044;'They have beaten me, again and again. Why? Because I am a proud citizen who will speak the truth! I don't believe that the ruling party will save us. And my weapon is logic, but theirs is the stick.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999044;This has to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999044;Go cry me a river.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999045;Election Fraud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999045;'Why are they allowed to change the rules during an election? Drawing random borders to scatter those who won't vote for them is not fair. It is fraud, I tell you! They divided our district between four others, because they knew how we would vote. FRAUD! That's what it is, I tell you!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999045;You are right, we have to do something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999045;Want me to play the world's smallest violin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999046;Request For Privacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999046;'Why does everyone stare at me when I make my vote? Do they really need to know? It is not like I am committing a crime or something, I simply want to vote in peace. Without having half of the polling station looking at me, that is.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999046;I guess some privacy would be in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999046;What's next? Blindfolds?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999047;Social Reform Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999047;The socialists have started a countrywide drive for social reforms in $COUNTRY$. Their methods are new and the law about them is rather ambiguous. Should we allow them to continue their campaign?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999047;Allow them to carry on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA999048;Allow them to carry on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999048;Ban the campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999049;Unemployment Issues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999049;The election is almost over, but liberals and socialists are still arguing about the current state of affairs. Unemployment is a problem, but both sides have decisive arguments for what they think has to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA999049;The liberals are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB999049;The socialists are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME999050;Unemployment Issues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC999050;Unemployment is still an important issue in $COUNTRY$, but all our recent attempts to crate new jobs have failed. During the election of $YEAR$, communists and fascists argued that their dogma is the only one that will give work to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
