EVTDESC200002;Our Indian subjects, under the leadership of Gandhi, have found novel ways to pester us. While they will not repeat the mistakes of their sepoy forebears and openly challenge our might, they have started to deny our right to rule over them by standing completely still and not responding to commands from their $COUNTRY_ADJ$ superiors no matter how much pressure is applied. This will undoubtedly affect production.;x

CWB_NAME;Cold War;x
CWB_DESC;"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and, in many cases, increasing measure of control from Moscow. Whatever conclusions may be drawn from these facts — and facts they are — this is certainly not the Liberated Europe we fought to build up. Nor is it one which contains the essentials of permanent peace." The words of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill underline the fragility of this new world order. Though the Allies defeated Nazi Germany in the second World War, a new standoff now exists between them and the Soviet Empire.;x
WW2_NAME;World War II;x
WW2_DESC;Hitler’s promises proved to be worth nothing, and the Munich agreement that had promised peace in our time was torn up within 6 months. The Western Allies steeled themselves for war, while the Soviet Union made a pact with the devil. The German attack on Poland meant war. Chamberlain wanted to “live to see the day when Hitlerism has been destroyed and a liberated Europe has been re-established.” He would be dead before the next year ended -- peace would take longer.;x
MOD_NAME;New Millenium;x
MOD_DESC;New York, the heart of capitalism. The fireworks rise into the sky to celebrate the arrival of a new Millenium full of optimism. But also the end of an eventful and often tragic one where humanity faced its biggest challenges yet. Despite all the hurdles, the United States of America has emerged from the 20th century as the world's only superpower. Under its leadership the West has vanquished fascism and communism and created a new order based on prosperity, growth and liberty for itself. The whole world is not at peace however. From Beirut to Beijing millions are still being exploited, either by their own or by foreign interests. As a result many harbour a deep resentment for this new American-led world order and its comparatively carefree citizens. The threats of terrorism and war are becoming increasingly menacing as technology and radicalism seem to advance at the same pace, and there are conflicts aplenty that may provide the fateful spark which will ignite the world.;x

EVTDESC1000002;Although Churchill promised the British Empire would fight on, in reality once London fell there was little resistance overseas. The island of Great Britain is now at our mercy and the British will lose their Empire to local native governments should we choose to annex it.
