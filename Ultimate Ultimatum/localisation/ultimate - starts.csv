MYSTRAS_NAME;Byzantium (A What If Game);;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MYSTRAS_DESC;Exactly 150 years have passed since the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453. After the fall and the death of Konstantinos Paleologos his brothers made a deal with the Sultan and managed to keep their home castle in Mystras and the land gone with it. They agreed to become vassals to the Ottoman Empire and aid to their military operations as allies. In those dark hours the Byzantine Empire was almost forgotten by the greek populations. The vassal state of Mystars was just a castle and not an Empire. At least that was what the Sultan believed. Only the humble family of the old Emperor Konstantinos Paleologos kept considering themselves heirs to the throne of Constantinople. And this only in their private conversations. Nevertheless, through rennaissance and enlighment years that followed, they managed to keep their byzantine identity and reinforce the byzantine identity of their people. But the Turks have reached their limit. They can go only down from now on. The Austrians backed by the armies of the Great Spanish Empire have already started to reclaim their territories in central Europe. Now Paleologoi family are waiting for the right moment....!!;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ENLIGHTDESC;In Britain, the childless death of Queen Elizabeth and ascension of James VI of Scotland to the English throne has united the crowns of Britain, laying the foundations for what would become the United Kindom of Great Britain. On the continent ceaseless religious and imperial conflicts rage on even as the Turks press against the very gates of Vienna. For the first time in history European Wars are being carried overseas as the Spanish, French, English and Dutch all vie to become rulers of the New World and its boundless riches. Meanwhile, the Italian Renaissance, pushed North and bolstered by the Protestant reformation, has spawned a new way of thinking in Northern Europe, resulting in the Enlightenment. New ways to live, rule and wage war are being discovered daily by the greatest minds in history. This is an age of glory, and now, more than ever, fortune favours the bold.;x
BM_EMPNAME;Empire;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_EMPDESC;European nations have fought each others for 14 long years in the War of the Spanish Succession. Now as the armies and delegations return home the true extent of the Imperial ambitions Europe has pursued for the last hundred years is revealed. Britain, united under a single flag since 1707, has grown from a European country with moderate sway to a global Empire controlling a great percentage of the world's trade and, at the expense of much of Europe, even access to the Mediterranean. Its Thirteen American Colonies, arguably its most populous Imperial territories, dominate the Eastern shores of the North American continent and contribute vastly to Britain's wealth. Indeed, the Atlantic Triangle, which sees traders acquire slaves in Africa for use in American plantations, the output of which is then shipped to British ports like Liverpool, is proving immensely profitable. And yet for all its wealth, Britain still does not reign supreme. French posessions extend from Canada all the way south to New Orleans, and the Spanish and Portuguese have practically divided the remainder of the new world between themselves. This competition and the fact that new territories are being discovered and colonised every day is sure to drive these Imperial powers to war once again. And to the victor goes the spoils.;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AMWI_NAME;American Revolution;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AMWI_DESC;The year is 1764. Following the Seven Years' War which has ended just a year ago with the Treaty of Paris, Britain has gained control of much of North America from its French and Spanish rivals. Despite this victory for the Empire there is a growing discontent amongst the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies. For all their services to the British crown during the French and Indian Wars and before it seems like they are only ever rewarded with ever-increasing contempt and legal restrictions. While not all share this feeling, for many freeborn Americans raised on the British Enlightenment values there is a creeping contradition between the liberal ideals preached in Britain and the policies applied in the colonies. For others, talk of abolitionism within England's high society and the prospect of peace with native Americans seem to threaten the way of life in the American South and the frontier. The idea that the colonies, indeed that Americans, could do much better on their own is starting to take hold even amongst the more privileged in American society. Now whether that idea turns into reality, is forgotten, or is used to other ends, is all up to you.;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RON_NAME;Rise of Napoleon;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RON_DESC;Europe is in turmoil. The fire of liberalism which had overturned a thousand years of French monarchy has consumed its own master. The French republic, as a result of war and civil disorder, was in total chaos. Facing bankruptcy, enemies in every direction and a weak, unpopular government at home, France was ripe for the taking for any ambitious revolutionary. This came in the form of Napoleon Bonaparte, a fairly competent general who, in 1799, returned from his Egyptian campaign to a hero's welcome in Paris. He quickly set about overthrowing the government and established himself as dictator. Whilst no longer a republic, France did not rid itself of its liberal pretences. To the contrary, under Napoleon the French army is now more determined, and more capable, than ever to overthrow what are considered by its revolutionaries to be outdated tyrannical governments across Europe. The stage is set for the Napoleonic wars.;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NAPEUR_NAME;Napoleon's Europe;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NAPEUR_DESC;Napoleon Bonaparte's goal of a united Europe is on the verge of being completed. Napoleonic France has either annexed or made client states out of most of the Europeon countries.  The only major countries left to oppose Napoleon are the Austrian Empire,Russian Empire,Sweden,and the United Kingdom. Only time will tell which side will be victorious.;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VICERA_NAME;The Victorian Era;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VICERA_DESC;The ideals of the French Revolution were believed to have met their final demise at the hands of the Ancien Régimes of Europe. The flames of revolution may have been put out for now, but the ideas of nationalism and liberalism can never die. This new era of unprecedented technological progress, doubts will be cast on certainties that have stood since time immemorial. Far away, across the briny foam, the riches of Asia and Africa beckon. Maestro, choose your instrument, and let the music play.;Le calme est revenu à Waterloo où les idéaux de la Révolution française semblaient avoir pris fin aux mains des anciens régimes d'Europe. Après les tribulations des guerres napoléoniennes, le consensus établi au Congrès de Vienne permit de rétablir un calme relatif sur un continent en proie aux troubles. Bien que les flammes de la révolution aient été, pour un temps, étouffées, les idéaux de liberté, de nationalisme et de libéralisme ne tardèrent pas à se révéler plus vivants que jamais. En Amérique, ces mêmes idéaux menacent de plonger la jeune république dans les tumultes d'une guerre civile. La princesse Victoria a 16 ans et va bientôt accéder au trône britannique, le plus grand empire industriel que le monde ait jamais connu. Cette accession, pour un règne aussi long que prospère, marque le début d'une ère qui va durer jusqu'à la Première Guerre mondiale. Au cours de cette nouvelle ère de progrès technologiques sans précédent, les certitudes de temps immémoriaux laisseront places à des doutes.;Der Staub über den Feldern von Waterloo, wo die Ideale der französischen Revolution vermeintlich durch die Hände der alten europäischen Regimes fielen, hat sich gelegt. Nach den Sorgen der napoleonischen Kriege hat der auf dem Wiener Kongress erreichte Konsens einem aufgewühlten Kontinent vorübergehend Ruhe verschafft. Obwohl die Flammen der Revolution nun vorerst erloschen sind, werden die Ideen menschliche Freiheit, Nationalismus und Liberalismus sich schon bald lebendiger als je zuvor zeigen. In den Amerikas drohen dieselben Ideen, eine junge Republik in die Verheerungen eines Bürgerkriegs zu stürzen. Prinzessin Victoria ist 16 Jahre alt und wird schon bald den Thron Großbritanniens besteigen, der größten Industriemacht, die es jemals gegeben hat. Ihre Thronbesteigung, Auftakt einer langen und erfolgreichen Regentschaft, markiert den Beginn eines Zeitalters, das sich bis zum ersten Weltkrieg erstreckt. In dieser Ära unübertroffener technologischer Fortschritte werden vielen althergebrachte Bestimmtheiten angezweifelt werden und neue Dogmen ihre Plätze einnehmen. Weit entfernt warten die Reichtümer Asiens und Afrikas und das Herz der Finsternis darauf, endlich auch im Konzert Europas besungen zu werden. Maestro, wählen Sie Ihr Instrument, und lassen Sie die Musik spielen.;;Parecía que los ideales de la Revolución Francesa habían encontrado su fin a manos de los estados del Antiguo Régimen de Europa. Las llamas de la revolución pueden haberse apagado por ahora, pero las ideas del nacionalismo y el liberalismo no morirán nunca. En esta nueva era de progreso tecnológico sin precedentes, se plantearán dudas sobre certezas que han permanecido inalterables desde tiempos inmemoriales. Muy lejos, más allá del mar, se hallan las riquezas de Asia y África. Maestro, elija su instrumento y que empiece la música.;;;;;;;;;x

The outcome is uncertain, but already this promises to be a new type of war as both sides have access to railroads, telegraphs, and repeating rifles. Meanwhile, in Europe, Great Britain is experimenting with the first iron-hulled steam-driven warship, a combination which promises to revolutionise the war at sea. World wide the industrial revolution is gathering speed as more and more nations start to industrialise.

FRA-PRU_NAME;Franco-Prussian War;;;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FRA-PRU_DESC;The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War, often referred to in France as the War of 1870, was a conflict between the two Great Powers of Continental Europe, the Second French Empire and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. In the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Prussia had annexed numerous territories and formed the North German Confederation. This destabilized the European balance of power established by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The conflict what was started as a simple diplomatic misunderstanding. Turn into a bloody conflict between the two, the French fear for united Germany and the increasing demand by the Germans to unite the remaining German states become the main concern for the preservation of a long peace for Europe, the shift of the Balance of Power is yet to be known but one thing for sure if whoever sides win, will dominate continental Europe and permanently shift the Balance of Power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WW1_NAME;The Great War;x
WW1_DESC;The state of peace in Europe today is fragile. The great powers of 1910 - France, Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia, have arranged themselves in a system of alliances to preserve the balance of power of the continent. Germany's power has also been growing greatly since their unification only a few decades prior, and the rapid development of this upstart power has done well to panic her competetors. Meanwhile, in the Balkan states, Austria-Hungary, Serbia, and yet other nations compete aggressively for dominance of the region. It is only a matter of time before Europe falls into the darkness of war, and we must prepare.;x

ESP_DESC;A group of generals from the Spanish army revolted against the Second Spanish Republic. The rebel coup was supported by a number of conservative groups,including the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right,monarchists such as the Carlists,"and the Fascist Falange. On April 19, 1937",General Francisco Franco managed to combine the Falange and the Carlist monarchist parties into one party under his rule.;;;;;;x;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WW2_NAME;World War II;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WW2_DESC;Hitler’s promises proved to be worth nothing, and the Munich agreement that had promised peace in our time was torn up within 6 months. The Western Allies steeled themselves for war, while the Soviet Union made a pact with the devil. The German attack on Poland meant war. Chamberlain wanted to “live to see the day when Hitlerism has been destroyed and a liberated Europe has been re-established.” He would be dead before the next year ended -- peace would take longer.;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CWB_NAME;Cold War;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CWB_DESC;From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and, in many cases, increasing measure of control from Moscow. Whatever conclusions may be drawn from these facts and facts they are  this is certainly not the Liberated Europe we fought to build up. Nor is it one which contains the essentials of permanent peace. -- The words of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill underline the fragility of this new world order. Though the Allies defeated Nazi Germany in the second World War, a new standoff now exists between them and the Soviet Empire.;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MOD_NAME;New Millenium;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MOD_DESC;New York, the heart of capitalism. The fireworks rise into the sky to celebrate the arrival of a new Millenium full of optimism. But also the end of an eventful and often tragic one where humanity faced its biggest challenges yet. Despite all the hurdles, the United States of America has emerged from the 20th century as the world's only superpower. Under its leadership the West has vanquished fascism and communism and created a new order based on prosperity, growth and liberty for itself. The whole world is not at peace however. From Beirut to Beijing millions are still being exploited, either by their own or by foreign interests. As a result many harbour a deep resentment for this new American-led world order and its comparatively carefree citizens. The threats of terrorism and war are becoming increasingly menacing as technology and radicalism seem to advance at the same pace, and there are conflicts aplenty that may provide the fateful spark which will ignite the world.;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FUT_DESC;Only 23 years after the promise of a new American century the United States of America stands as a mere shadow of its former self. The more divided population, incompetent leaders, and increasing isolationism has led the once great global Superpower into a chaotic nations on a brink of another civil war. Even the hard lessons of the 1861 seem to be all but forgotten as old differences between the more conservative and progressives part of the country resurface. Meanwhile abroad, globalisation has made capitalism the only economic ideal. China and the rest of the remaining communist countries in East Asia has undergone a peaceful democratic revolution after its populace demand more open and more democracy, it seems Tiananmen has become a backbone of this revolution. But while ideological wars are a distant memory, the old tribal conflicts of ethnic nationalism burn with a renewed force, fuelled by the exponential growth of new dynamic economies.;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
