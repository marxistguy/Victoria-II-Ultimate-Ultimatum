form_burgundy_title;SS-Staat Burgund;x
form_burgundy_desc;It is becoming increasingly clear that Germany will have trouble keeping the French Resistance down as well as keeping Himmler’s SS in line. In response, the fuhrer has given his blessing to the creation of the SS State of Burgundy as oft requested by Himmler, thus focusing Himmler’s attentions elsewhere and allowing Burgundy to deal with the Frenchmen.;x
form_brittany_title;Nazi Brittany;x
form_brittany_desc;Although Burgundy has been given independence, the Reich still directly administers land in northwest France. This creates a problem, as not only are we still dealing with the French resistance, the area is also cut off from Germany proper by Burgundy. By giving Brittany independence as a German protectorate, we can solve this issue just as we did Burgundy.;x

the_west_french_land_exchange_desc;With the war over we no longer need to keep control of the western coast of France. The Vichy have made several petitions for it, though we would like something in return. We can demand the Vichy give their northern provinces in exchange for the coast, allowing us to set up future states in France in the future.;x

breakup_british_empire_desc;Although we have conquered the British isles, the empire has survived in the hearts and minds of many. By instituting a British state we can divide the population and take away many of the dissenters, and by breaking up the empire we can create several highly loyal nations to keep check on the Brits.;x
